## About
I received a BA in Public Health-Global Health from the University of Washington in 2019. I'm currently a second-year Master's student pursuing a Master of Public Health (MPH) at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health in the Department of Epidemiology, with a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science. I'm passionate about applying analytical and epidemiological skills to address real-world health issues.

## About
I received a BA in Public Health-Global Health from the University of Washington in 2019 and a Master of Public Health (MPH) degree from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health with a concentration in Epidemiology and a certificate in Applied Biostatistics and Public Health Data Science in 2023. I'm passionate about applying analytical and epidemiological skills to address real-world health issues.
